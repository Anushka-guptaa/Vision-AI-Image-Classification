# Vision-AI-Image-Classification
A comprehensive 5-day deep learning bootcamp focusing on end-to-end *computer vision pipeline* for classifying images using *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* and *Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)*, trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Cats vs Dogs datasets.
The project demonstrates a complete AI workflow — from data preprocessing and augmentation to model evaluation and visualisation(ROC curve, confusion matrix, training curves) — built in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks across three different datasets:
- *MNIST*: Handwritten digit recognition
- *CIFAR-10*: Object classification (10 categories)
- *Cats vs Dogs*: Binary image classification

It covers:

* Loading and preprocessing datasets (normalisation, reshaping, augmentation)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* Training a custom CNN model
* Enhancing performance with Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2
* Evaluating with multiple metrics like using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
* Visualising results using training curves, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve
* Sample predictions on test images
